prime-ext.js
==============
Just a few utility functions I use with prime

Usage
-----
I'm keeping this stuff undocumented until I'm happy with it. Feel free to browse the source. I've updated it to use the libraries I've moved to and to work with the current prime. Really this library served as a bridge for protolus as I ported it from rhino/MooTools to node.js and have moved away from using object libs in general.

Expect most of my repos to reflect this. But I still have no docs for you, sorry.

Enjoy,
